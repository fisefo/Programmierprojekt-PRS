# big TODO exam loop

# big TODO 2nd exam loop

# todo epilogue

#* mockup:
# def prologue():
#     print(game_text['prologue'])
#     user_input = input('Proceed to -> "study"ing?')
#     while user_input != 'study':
#         print('The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. In your case, you are point A, '
#               'the holidays are point B, and the straight line is studying. No way around it, either.')
#         user_input = input('Proceed to -> "study"ing?')

# todo: learn how pushing works
