This file contains the function-calls for the main stages
of the PRS 2022 final project (also referred to as "game") to show the structure of the game and avoid clutter.
The main stages are: Beginning the semester (Prologue), Studying, Pro1 exam, CLT exam, Final state (Epilogue)
Depending on whether the player passed the exams, the final state will be different (Win or Lose).
