All functions and variables necessary for the CLT-exam part of the PRS 2022 final project.
This script checks user input for whether the player entered a correct codeword* and computes an according
grade on a pass or fail basis.
* The codeword is a 'lattice word', meaning every substring of it must have as much or more letters of the letter i as
i+1, i.e. aabbcc, aaabbcdecbdf, ab; the word must begin with an "a".
